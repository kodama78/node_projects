# node_projects

## Node projects is a course that I purchased and downloaded from eduonix.com. It includes 10 projects that use node to build the back end portion of the project. The projects include:

1. Simple Web Server
2. Basic Express site
3. User Login System
4. Node Blog System
5. Commmunity Events
6. Bookstore
7. ChatIO
8. Doctor Directory
9. Portfolio App
10. elearning System

## My hope for these courses is to provide a strong foundation in node and add it to my technical toolkit
